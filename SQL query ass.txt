1.1 Write a SQL query to retrieve all data points (columns) from the "Expenses" table.
SELECT * FROM Expenses;

1.2Modify your query to select only specific columns relevant to your analysis.For example, you might choose "date," "category," and "amount" to analyze spending patterns by category and date.
SELECT date FROM expense_tracker.expenses;

1.3 Filtering by Date Range: Write a query to retrieve expenses charged between a specific date range (e.g., January 1, 2024, to February 15, 2024). Remember to use the appropriate data type for the "date" column when specifying the date range in your query.
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
WHERE date BETWEEN '2021-07-04' AND '2021-07-15' ;

2.1 Filtering by Category: Write a query to find all expenses belonging to a specific category (e.g., "Entertainment").
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
WHERE category like '%Entertainment' ;

2.2 Filtering with Comparison Operators: Find expenses with an amount greater than a certain value (e.g., $50).
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
WHERE amount > 50;

2.3 Combining Filters (AND):
Refine your query to find expenses that meet multiple criteria. For example, you might search for expenses greater than $75 AND belonging to the "Food" category.
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
WHERE amount > 50 AND category = 'food' ;

2.4 Combining Filters (OR): Modify your query to find expenses belonging to one category or another (e.g., "Transportation" OR "Groceries").
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
WHERE category ='Transportation' OR  category = 'Groceries' ;

2.5 Filtering with NOT: Write a query to display expenses that are NOT related to a specific category (e.g., "Rent").
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
WHERE NOT category = 'RENT'

3.1 Sorting by Amount: Write a query to display all expenses sorted by amount in a specific order (e.g., descending order for highest to lowest spending).
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
ORDER BY Amount desc;

3.2 Sorting by Date and Category:
Modify your query to sort expenses based on multiple columns. For example, you might sort first by date (descending order) and then by category (ascending order) to see recent spending trends by category.
SELECT * FROM expense_tracker.expenses
ORDER BY date DESC, category ASC;
